This is happy. It's a theme project. Happy theme.

The Happy theme is a parent theme based off the Hybrid Core framework. 

You can see a live demo at http://happyloops.com

This theme is under active development, all of which is happening live on the above URL.

For more information, check out this post series where I share how I'm building a theme from the ground up, and sharing the experience: http://krogsgard.com/talks/wordpress/theme-build/
